Building on top of the conditional exercise, write a script that will loop through a list of users where each item is a user dictionary from the previous exercise printing out each user’s status on a separate line. Additionally, print the line number at the beginning of each line, starting with line 1. Be sure to include a variety of user configurations in the users list.

User Keys:

'admin' - a boolean representing whether the user is an admin user.
'active' - a boolean representing whether the user is currently active.
'name' - a string that is the user’s name.

Depending on the values of the user, print one of the following to the screen when you run the script.

Print (ADMIN) followed by the user’s name if the user is an admin.
Print ACTIVE - followed by the user’s name if the user is active.
Print ACTIVE - (ADMIN) followed by the user’s name if the user is an admin and active.
Print the user’s name if neither active nor an admin.



#!/usr/bin/env python3

users = [
  { 'admin': True, 'active': True, 'name': 'Claudio' },
  { 'admin': True, 'active': False, 'name': 'Alessandro' },
  { 'admin': False, 'active': True, 'name': 'Alberto' },
  { 'admin': False, 'active': False, 'name': 'Daniele' },
]

line = 1

for user in users:
  prefix = f"{line} "

  if user['admin'] and user['active']:
    prefix += "Active Admin "
  elif user['admin']:
    prefix += "Admin "
  elif user['active']:
    prefix += "Active "
  
  print(prefix + user['name'])
  line += 1
