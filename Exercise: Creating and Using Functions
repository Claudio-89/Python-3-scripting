Functions are a great way to organize your code for reuse and clarity. Write a script that does the following:

- Prompts the user for a message to echo.
- Prompts the user for the number of times to repeat the message. If no response is given, then the count should default to 1.
- Defines a function that takes a message and count then prints the message that many times.

To end the script, call the function with the user-defined values to print to the screen.



#!/usr/bin/env python3.6

message = input("Message: ")
count = input("Number of repeats (1 by default): ").strip()

if count:
  count = int(count)
else:
  count = 1

def echo_echo(message, count):
    while count > 0:
        print(message)
        count -= 1
echo_echo(message, count)
