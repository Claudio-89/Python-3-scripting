Write a Python script that sets the following variables:

1. first_name - Set to your first name
2. last_name - Set to your last name
3. age - Set to your age as an integer
4. birth_date - Set to your birthdate as a string

Using the variables, print the following to the screen when you run the script:

My name is FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME.
I was born on BIRTH_DATE, and I'm AGE years old.


#!/usr/bin/env python3

first_name = "Claudio"
last_name = "A"
age = 30
birth_date = "26-09-1989"

print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name}." )
print(f"I was born on {birth_date}, and I'm {age} years old.")
